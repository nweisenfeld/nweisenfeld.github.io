So I will _not_ be attending AGBT this year, however I've
spent the past 8 months working with David Jaffe on a new assembler
for [10X Genomics].  David will be presenting this work in a 
talk entitled

> "Low cost Linked-Reads yield long range haplotyped human assemblies from a nanogram of DNA”

So I hope you can attend and check out some exciting new work.  We've just
scratched the surface of what can be achieved with 10X data, and yet we're
generating contigs on par with Discovar De Novo, but now with long scaffolds 
and phasing.  And we're doing it with data that's even less expensive.

Check out the talk!
