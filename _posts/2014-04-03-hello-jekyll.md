So up until recently, I had a little Wordpress blog that I hosted
using a sevice called [Textdrive][]. Textdrive was a nice, simple
Unix-based hosting solution that, prior to [Joyent][]'s purchase
of the company, provided great value for $15/mo.  But sometime about
a week ago, the lights went dark.  At this point I should point out
that this was no longer Joyent's company. While Joyent seems to be
focusing on major cloud services, the Textdrive of late was a reboot
of the original shared-hosting provider, catering to the low-end.
The bankruptcy of a startup is not unusual, especially one catering
to the low-margin side of a line of business, but what *is* unusual
is how the company managed to shut down without even emailing any
of its customers. I literally found out about the shutdown by
attempting (and failing) to contact my server, only days after it
had apparently been wiped clean. And while a notice was posted on
Textdrive's support forums, such a notice would only reach the
angriest and least busy customers, those who spent their days
trawling the support forums for help.  I can imagine what the
explanation for all of this was, but it will be interesting to see
how it turns out.  An amusing side note is that had I been a regular
reader of Wired, I might have read [this][wired] article about how
my hosting provider had failed.  And had I done so, I would have known
a full month before someone came in and shut off the lights.  In the
next few days, I'll describe the genesis of this new blog.
