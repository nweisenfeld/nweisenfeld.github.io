title: "Direct determination of diploid genome sequences"

Our paper describing Supernova, the [10x][10X Genomics] whole-genome _de novo_ 
assembler, is now available on-line (for free, thankfully) at 
[Genome Research][GR].  Supernova is unique in that it focuses on the generation
of diploid assemblies and is entirely turn-key.  With proper input data, we
generate assemblies with 100+ Kb contigs, 10+ Mb scaffolds, and 4+ Mb phase 
blocks.  As part of the validation of this paper, we assembled a number of
genomes that are now available in [GenBank][NCBI].  Feel free to email or hit 
me up on Twitter as [@weisen] if you have any questions.
