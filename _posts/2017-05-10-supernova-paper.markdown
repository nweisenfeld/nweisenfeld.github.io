Our paper describing Supernova, the [10x][10X Genomics] whole-genome _de novo_ 
assembler, is now available on-line (for free, thankfully) at 
[Genome Research][GR].  Supernova is unique in that it focuses on the generation
of diploid assemblies and is entirely turn-key.  With proper input data, we
generate assemblies that are complete, contiguous, accurate, and phased.
 As part of the validation of this paper, we assembled seven
genomes that are now available in [GenBank][NCBI].  Feel free to email or say hi
on [Twitter] if you have questions.
