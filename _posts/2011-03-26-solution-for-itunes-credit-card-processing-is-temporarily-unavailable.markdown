Slightly off the beaten path, but I like to document this stuff publicly in case someone stumbles here via Google:

The solution for:

> Credit card processing is temporarily unavailable. You may continue to browse the store. Please try to make your purchase later.  

from the Apple Store turns out to be:

1. Select Store->View My Account from iTunes
2. Click "edit" next to your credit card info and enter the CVV or security code
3. Click "done" at the bottom.

How this matters for free updates, why this was necessary in the first place, or what it has to do with the error message recevied, is entirely unclear. But it worked for me (tm).
