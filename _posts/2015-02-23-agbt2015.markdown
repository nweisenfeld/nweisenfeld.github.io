I'll be talking at [AGBT2015] about ``Personal Genome
Assembly.''  This talk discusses how our group's new version of
[DISCOVAR], called DISCOVAR *de novo*, can be used to generate a
whole-genome assembly of very high quality, for about $10k in 
sequencing and compute costs, all in.  

DISCOVAR *de novo* can assemble multiple-samples together, such as
a familial trio or a tumor-normal pair.  This allows the assembly to
conveniently depict differences between samples, even for events
that are not alignable to a reference.

We believe that DISCOVAR *de novo* does more with short-read data than
has been achieved thus far, but we acknowledge that short-read data has
its limitations.  The second part of my talk will highlight recent work
with a powerful new [datatype] being unveiled at this year's conference.

Free free to email me (see below) if you'd like to talk in person, 
otherwise I hope you'll make my talk at
7:30 p.m. on Thursday in the Bioinformatics parallel session.
