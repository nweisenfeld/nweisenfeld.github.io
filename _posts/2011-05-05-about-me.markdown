<p>I am a computational neuroscientist and computer scientist, currently working as a post-doctoral fellow at Children's Hospital Boston and Harvard Medical School. &nbsp;I completed my Ph.D. in Cognitive and Neural Systems in 2010 studying Computational Neuroanatomy at Boston University, my master's in Computer Science at MIT in 2002 studying computer vision for image-guided surgery, and my Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania in 1991. I'm currently working on image analysis problems related to newborn brain imaging, adolescent sequelae of premature birth, and childhood epilepsy.</p>
<p>Between academic programs, I've worked at the National Institutes of Health in both the (then) Division of Computer Research and Technology on parallel algorithms and systems software, and at the National Institute of Mental Health on PET image analysis in schizophrenia. &nbsp;I've also held industry posts at govWorks, Inc., a dot-com era web startup, and at Nokia.</p>
<p>My abbreviated cv is <a href="http:&#47;&#47;neilweisenfeld.com&#47;wp&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2012&#47;02&#47;weisenfeld-resume-20Feb2012.pdf">here<&#47;a>.  Note that I keep my phone numbers off of the on-line version, for obvious reasons, but feel free to e-mail me inquiries.</p>
