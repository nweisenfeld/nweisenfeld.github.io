I'm pleased to write that my last paper at Harvard Medical School
is in [press][1] in the Journal of Pediatrics.  In the course of
working on Heidi Als's studies of ex-preterm adolescents, it became
clear that pure template-fusion segmentation algorithms could go
horribly awry in the face of missing or atrophied structures, but
that a hybrid template-fusion/intensity segmentation algorithm,
such as my own, could do nicely.  Simultaneously, we were
working with Mustafa Sahin's *tuberous sclerosis* patients
and I noticed occasional cerebellar atrophy.  

Putting two and two together, with a good deal of help from Jurriaan
Peters, Peter Tsai, and genotype data supplied by Kira Dies, we
noticed a reduction in cerebellar volume in the subgroup of patients
whose tuberous sclerosis was explained by a known pathogenic mutation
in *TSC2*.  The finding was short and straightforward, but the paper
reviews some evidence from the literature that indicate, roughly, why this
might have occurred and, I believe, link these together for the first time.
