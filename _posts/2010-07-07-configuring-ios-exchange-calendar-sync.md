If you're using the "Exchange" method of synchronizing calendars
and notice that not all of your multiple calendars from your Google
Apps for Domains setup are being sync'd down, follow these instructions:

[www.google.com/support/mobile/bin/answer.py?answer=139206](http://www.google.com/support/mobile/bin/answer.py?answer=139206)

Basically, for those in the know, it's the usual m.google.com sync
stuff, but there's a link in the fine print at the bottom for Google
Apps for Domains.

Also note: if someone directs you to a url with "iphoneselect" in
it, that's only when accessing calendars in a non-push way through
the iphone's "Gmail" setup. If you use the Exchange setup for getting
push calendars, follow the url I posted above.
