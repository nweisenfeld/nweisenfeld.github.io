<p>If you're studying methods for image analysis relating to brain development, there will be a workshop at MICCAI 2011 called, appropriately, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;lsiit-miv.u-strasbg.fr&#47;miccai2011-workshop&#47;miccai_workshop.html">Image Analysis of Human Brain Development.<&#47;a>  </p>
<p>I probably will <b>not<&#47;b> be submitting a paper, as I should have a submission on segmentation in older kids at the main conference, but I will be reviewing papers for and attending the workshop.</p>
<p>This will be a great meeting, so please sign up - paper deadline is June 3 -- see the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;lsiit-miv.u-strasbg.fr&#47;miccai2011-workshop&#47;miccai_workshop.html">site<&#47;a>.</p>
