On Thursday, October 19 at 11:00 a.m., join me at ASHG for a talk
about *de novo* assembly applied to MHC/HLA.  This work examines
our current development version of Supernova(tm), the [10x Genomics][]
*de novo* assembler, specifically in the MHC region.  For the samples
that we studied, MHC was in a single, phased scaffold.  At the exon
level, the peptide binding sites were correctly reconstructed, to
base-level accuracy, for 35 of 36 genes x subjects.  Most whole-genes 
were reconstructed perfectly, with some genes having a small number
of putative subtitutions and indels.

This is definitely a work-in-progress, but we're looking toward a future
when we can routinely assemble, *de novo*, the entire MHC region.
