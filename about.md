<p>I received my Ph.D. in Cognitive and Neural Systems in 2010 studying Computational Neuroanatomy at Boston University, my master&rsquo;s in Computer Science at MIT in 2002 studying computer vision for image-guided surgery, and my Bachelor&rsquo;s in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania in 1991. 


&nbsp;He is currently a Research Associate in Radiology at Harvard Medical School and a postdoctoral fellow in the Computational Radiology Laboratory at Children&rsquo;s Hospital Boston working on image analysis problems related to newborn brain imaging, adolescent sequelae of premature birth, and childhood epilepsy.</p>
<p>Between academic programs, Neil has worked at the National Institutes of Health in both the (then) Division of Computer Research and Technology on parallel algorithms and systems software, and at the National Institute of Mental Health on PET image analysis in schizophrenia. &nbsp;Neil has held industry posts at govWorks, Inc., a dot-com era web startup as a senior architect, and at Nokia as a system software engineer.</p>
