I am a computational biologist and computer scientist at the Broad
Institute of Harvard and MIT.  I'm currently working on the development
of novel algorithms for genome assembly.

My post-doctoral work, as well as my doctoral dissertation research,
was performed at Children's Hospital Boston and Harvard Medical
School where I worked on image analysis problems related to newborn
brain imaging, adolescent sequelae of premature birth, and childhood
epilepsy.

I completed my Ph.D. in Cognitive and Neural Systems in 2010 studying
computational neuroanatomy at Boston University, my master's in
Computer Science at MIT in 2002 studying computer vision for
image-guided surgery, and my Bachelor's in Computer Science and
Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania in 1991. 

Between academic programs, I've worked at the National Institutes
of Health in both the (then) Division of Computer Research and
Technology on parallel algorithms and systems software, and at the
National Institute of Mental Health on PET image analysis in
schizophrenia. &nbsp;I've also held industry posts at govWorks,
Inc., a dot-com era web startup, and at Nokia.
