<p>If you're using the "Exchange" method of synchronizing calendars and notice that not all of your multiple calendars from your Google Apps for Domains setup are being sync'd down, follow these instructions:</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.google.com&#47;support&#47;mobile&#47;bin&#47;answer.py?answer=139206">http:&#47;&#47;www.google.com&#47;support&#47;mobile&#47;bin&#47;answer.py?answer=139206<&#47;a></p>
<p>Basically, for those in the know, it's the usual m.google.com&#47;sync stuff, but there's a link in the fine print at the bottom for Google Apps for Domains.</p>
<p>Also note: if someone directs you to a url with "iphoneselect" in it, that's only when accessing calendars in a non-push way through the iphone's "Gmail" setup. &Acirc;&nbsp;If you use the Exchange setup for getting push calendars, follow the url I posted above.</p>
