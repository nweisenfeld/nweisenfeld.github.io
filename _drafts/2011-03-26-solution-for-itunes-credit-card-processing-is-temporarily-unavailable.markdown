<div class="posterous_autopost">
Slightly off the beaten path, but I like to document this stuff publicly in case someone stumbles here via Google:</p>
<p>The solution for:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Credit card processing is temporarily unavailable. You may continue to browse the store. Please try to make your purchase later.<&#47;p><br />
from the Apple Store turns out to be:<br />
<a id="more"></a><a id="more-202"></a></p>
<p>1. Select Store->View My Account from iTunes<br />
2. Click "edit" next to your credit card info and enter the CVV or security code<br />
3. Click "done" at the bottom.</p>
<p>How this matters for free updates, why this was necessary in the first place, or what it has to do with the error message recevied, is entirely unclear. &nbsp;But it worked for me (tm).</p>
