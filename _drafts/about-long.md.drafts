title: About Me
---

Hi there.  Here's more than a little about me.

I've been working at the crossroads between computers, medicine,
and medical research for longer than I care to admit.  I completed my
undergraduate study in Computer Science and Engineering at the
University of Pennsylvania.  I graduated with honors, having
worked for two years with Eric A. Hoffman's awesome team developing
a system called VIDA (Volumetric Image Display and Analysis, as I
remember).

After Penn, I was lucky enough to land a position as an engineer at the
National Institutes of Health working on parallel supercomputer
application for medicine.  After a few years, I left for the
Experimental Therapeutics Branch at the National Institute of Mental
Health where I was responsible for image analysis for a large number of
functional imaging studies, primarily in Schizophrenia.

After NIH, I completed my master's in Computer Science at MIT, working with
Ron Kikinis at Brigham and Women's Hospital's Surgical Planning Lab and
Eric Grimson at MIT. My thesis was the development of a stereo 3D 
capture system for measuring exposed surfaces within the operating room.
I spent a good deal of time (approximately 13 surgeries) working in the
OR, primarily aiding in navigation during brain tumor and epilepsy
surgery.  I was also fortunate enough to use the SPL's prototype
neuronavigation system to build a system for tracking a transcranial
magnetic stimulation probe in real-time.  

I left MIT headed for industry and worked during the "dot-com" boom on a
company called govWorks (see the movie "Startup.COM"), and then on a
television-Internet convergence device at Nokia Home Communications.
After each of these companies folded, I was anxious to get back to
research, and started working with Simon Warfield then at Brigham and
Women's Hospital and later at Boston Children's Hospital.  While working
with Simon, I was appointed Research Associate at Harvard Medical
School, and I worked on novel image analysis algorithsm for neonatal brain 
imaging.  My collaborators applied these techniques to the study of
outcomes from premature birth, maternal drug addiction, and epilepsy.

I completed my Ph.D. in Cognitive and Neural Systems from Boston
University in 2010, based on my ongoing work at Boston Children's
Hospital.  The algorithm that was the centerpiece of my disseration
was published as a NeuroImage article that has since been cited 58
times, as of February, 2014.  My last paper at Harvard Medical
School described a comparison of unique imaging features of two
genotypes in a rare genetic disease called Tuberous Sclerosis Complex.

Since sometime in 2012, I have been a staff scientist at the Broad
Institute in Cambridge where I'm currently a Senior Computational
Biologist.
